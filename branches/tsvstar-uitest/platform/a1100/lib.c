GetBatteryTemperature usually will get back temperature of battery compartment/batteries. GetBatteryTemperature is implemented in Canon's firmware for SX120IS.
Firmware entry point is identified but function is not usable. 
Camera will crash if Canon's GetBatteryTemperature is called by CHDK.
To avoid a crash Canon's GetBatteryTemperature must not called. As long CHDK general code do not distinguish between cameras that support or don't support GetBatteryTemperature, 
this function will be implemented as specific CHDK-code. It returns always with -99
This overrides original canon entry point from stubs_entry.S
